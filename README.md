Hi am Ngari Francis Ngethe an Information Technology specialist.
I consider my very curious because various cutting edge technologies spark my interests.
Still young in the industry, about an year of experience as IT Specialist @ Staffing Africa, well it's an outsourcing..
Learned a lot as an intern and onething to map out is that, the sperk to actually discect the field of cloud was born @ the specific company.
My first interaction in a working environment with a cloud service provider; Digital ocean came about when i was managing a mail server hosted on an ubuntu server.
The urge to learn more about cloud technologies grew and i later enrolled fully to learn more,got an opportunity to learn via ALX programme which is paternerd with AWS cloud provider.
Later 2022 took step out of working field to do personal development interms of learning, growing skills and so much more..
it been a journey, thats all i can say
